1. Deactivate Cart66 Lite through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Delete the cart66 directory from the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. WARNING: Do not delete the plugin using the link in the WordPress plugins menu because that will delete the cart66 database as well.

To Uninstall Cart66 Lite

1. Deactivate Cart66 Lite thorugh the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Click the "delete" link to delete the Cart66 Lite plugin. This will remove all of the Cart66 Lite files from your plugins directory and will delete the database tables used by Cart66.

When Cart66 Lite is installed it will create a page called "store" and a few sub-pages under the "store" page. If you no longer want those pages, you can delete them through the WordPress pages panel.

It is important not to move or rename the store pages, otherwise Cart66 will not function properly. For example, if you move or rename the slug for the store/cart page, Cart66 will not know where to send folks after they add a product to their shopping cart.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I get an error that says: The script tried to execute a method or access a property of an incomplete object =

This error occurs when other plugins you have installed, or your theme, starts a session before Cart66 Lite has been loaded. The solution is to look in your other plugins for a line that says `session_start()` and then comment out that line by placing two slashes at the front of the line like: `// session_start();`
